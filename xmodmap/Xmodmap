! For use with xcape:
!hyper_l is mod4 by default
remove mod4 = Hyper_L
!Map an unused modifier's keysym to the spacebar's keycode and make it a
!control modifier. Hyper_L is a good candidate.
keycode 65 = Hyper_L
!Map space to an unused keycode (to keep it around for xcape to use).
keycode any = space
